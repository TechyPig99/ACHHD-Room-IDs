# ACHHD-Room-IDs
These Room IDs are intended for use
with a cheat plugin, specifically
[Vapecord-ACHHD-Plugin](https://github.com/RedShyGuy/Vapecord-ACHHD-Plugin) by RedShyGuy.
I plan to add more IDs in the future but
for now it is just room IDs.
# How to use
Unfortunately cheats are only available to
3DS users with CFW. If you have CFW and the
plugin installed press Select, go to 
"Movement Codes" turn on "Room Warping",
and hold R and X then enter a ID
